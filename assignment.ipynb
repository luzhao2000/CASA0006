    "Poor visibility conditions increase the likelihood of severe traffic accidents, posing an endangering human life and property safety. To reduce casualties and enhance the effectiveness of accident management, it is essential to predict the severity of accidents accurately, allowing limited police and first aid resources to be deployed timely. This research seeks to establish highly accurate supervised machine learning models to predict the severity of traffic accidents during night-time in London. Utilizing traffic accident data from 2019 to 2022, the study intends to support police and hospital emergency departments in preparing for and responding to accidents of varying severity."

    "Traffic accidents cause serious safety issue and severe damage to private and social property (Silva and Saraee, 2019). Traffic accidents are not completely random, which can be predict based on some aspects of factors with relatively high accuracy (Antonio, 2019). There are many studies on traffic accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some scholars are committed to researching the factors that have significant impacts on the severity of traffic accident. Sapsirisavat and Mahicul (2021) employed logistic regression to reveal that driving at night significantly increases the risk of serious health problems caused by traffic accidents in Thailand. Similarly, Liu et al. (2019) used a binomial logistic model to identify important factors that influence the severity of traffic accidents at night in China, including driver characteristics, light conditions, and road situations. Rain-related factors and human reaction time were also found to affect the occurrence of traffic accidents (Silva and Saraee, 2019). However, the factors influencing traffic accidents may differ across regions and cities and need to be analyzed accordingly (Liu et al., 2019).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to identifying significant factors, scholars have also focused on improving prediction methods to enhance the accuracy of traffic accident severity and risk prediction. For instance, Al-Mistarehi et al. (2022) demonstrated that random forests are excellent machine learning methods for predicting traffic accident severity, and they combined high-resolution remote sensing images to analyze spatial distribution characteristics. Ren et al. (2018) developed a TARPML model to predict high-risk traffic accident areas in Beijing based on weather, air quality, traffic flows, and other factors. However, it is still hard for the police and the Emergency Center to allocate resources more accurately and efficiently according to the predicted demands.\n",
    "Few scholars have distinguished between the prediction of traffic accidents during the day and at night, even though low illumination conditions increase the frequency and severity of accidents that occur during the night-time period (Haworth and Rechnitzer, 1993; Liu et al., 2019). Overall, the importance of identifying significant factors and improving prediction methods for traffic accidents cannot be ignored. It also emphasizes the need to distinguish between accidents that occur during the day and at night, as different factors may influence the severity and occurrence of accidents."

Although it uses the training data effectively and prevents overfitting to some extent, it is time-consuming and computationally intensive (Abhishek, 2023).

    "Confusion matrix is an important metric for evaluating the performance of classification. Classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are four measures that reflect the accuracy of prediction from different perspectives based on the confusion matrix (Al-Mistarehi et al., 2022). Classification accuracy is the proportion of correctly predicted data (Al-Mistarehi et al., 2022). Recall represents the proportion of positive classes that are correctly classified (Al-Mistarehi et al., 2022). F1 score balances the importance of precision and recall, which is useful to compare the performance of different models when data imbalance is noticeable (Al-Mistarehi et al., 2022)."

    "The CART model achieved a high level of prediction accuracy (83.47%), which can accurately predict slight level traffic accidents with a 0.84 precision score, and the corresponding recall value is about 0.99, indicating rare misclassification of slight traffic accidents. However, the performance in predicting serious traffic accidents is poor, with the precision score is 0.15 and a low corresponding recall (about 0.008). The F1 score of slight level prediction is about 0.91 and that of serious is about 0.015. In this case, CART is unable to predict fatal level traffic accidents, which can also be seen in the confusion matrix below, fatal traffic accidents are predicted as mild (51) and severe (2). In addition, the most important features of CART were found to be the type of borough, road type, and date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forest achieved a prediction accuracy of about 83.97%, outperforming CART. The precision of Slight accidents prediction is 0.8399 and the recall is about 0.9995 indicating the classification of most slight accidents into the correct category. However, the random forest model was failed to predict both serious and fatal level traffic accidents under this situation. Road types and first road class are two important factors affect the prediction accuracy of that random forest model."

    "The CART model had a slightly higher precision for predicting slight level accidents compared to the random forest model, while the latter model got higher F1 score and performs better overall due to the imbalanced data. In contrast, CART performed much better in predicting serious-level accidents as random forest failed to predict any serious accident correctly. However, both models failed to predict fatal-level traffic accidents, indicating that more important features should be considered based on the basic situation in London when building models is necessary to improve the accuracy. In addition, the study also highlights the importance of the selected feature in predicting traffic accident severity. It can be found that no matter which model is established, the selected features in the study have low importance values, indicating that they may not be sufficient to accurately predict traffic accident severity in London at night.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the established models can predict traffic accident severity in London under low visibility accurately, there are still some limitations. First, the prediction accuracy for the severity of traffic accidents is limited. Since the number of traffic accidents in real life is significantly less than that of mild traffic accidents, it is necessary to increase the data set of the training model to train the model and improve the prediction accuracy to a certain extent. Secondly, the air quality index is only calculated based on the data of the limited air quality stations to obtain the average PM2.5 particle concentration hourly updated. This could result in errors in predicting the severity. Using meteorological satellite data could provide higher-resolution air quality data, which could help to enhance the accuracy."

    "In conclusion, machine learning can predict traffic accident severity in London during the night-time period accurately. The CART model has better performance in predicting mild and serious traffic accidents in London at night, while the random forest model was slightly better in predicting slight traffic accidents. However, neither model can predict fatal traffic accidents. The study highlights the importance of location, time, and road facilities in predicting traffic accident severity. Future work could focus on enhancing the accuracy of fatal traffic to help emergency services prepare in advance and potentially save more lives."
